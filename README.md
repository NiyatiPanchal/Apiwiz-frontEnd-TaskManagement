# Framework

The front-end is developed using the following technologies and frameworks:

- **`React.js`** : A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **`Material-UI`** : A popular React UI framework that provides a set of components and styles for creating modern and responsive user interfaces.

# Instructions to Run

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

2. Clone this repository:

```yml
git clone https://github.com/NiyatiPanchal/Apiwiz-frontEnd-TaskManagement.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

```yml
cd Apiwiz-frontEnd-TaskManagement
```

4. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:

```yml
npm install
```

5. Run the server:

```yml
npm start
```

7. The server should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

# Challanges

One challenge I faced was overriding the default styles of the Datepicker component. Material-UI provides default styling to components, which sometimes interferes with our custom styles.
